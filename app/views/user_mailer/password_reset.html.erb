<h1>Password reset</h1>

<p>To reset your password click the link below:</p>
<%= link_to "Reset password", edit_password_reset_url(@user.reset_token,
                                                      email: @user.email) %>

<p>This link will expire in 2 hours.</p>

<p>If you did not request your password to be reset, just do nothing and your
password will not change. However, you should probably contact support about 
someone else trying to reset your password. Give us a ring and we'll see if it
was a l33t h4ck3r or if the computer just had a brain fart and sent it by mistake.
